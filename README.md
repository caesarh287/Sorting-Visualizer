# Sorting Visualizer

This is a sorting visualizer I made from a tutorial from youtube to help me comprehend the similarities between all the sorting algorithms. 
I decided to include 5 algorithms ranging from worst time complexity to best. The following algorithms were
included:
- Bubble Sort (time complexity: O(n^2)
- Heap Sort (time complexity: O(nlog(n)) -> My Personal Favorite
- Merge Sort (time complexity: O(nlog(n))
- Quick Sort (time complexity: O(nlog(n))
- Radix Sort (time complexity: O(nk)) -> k = Amount of Digits in the value inside array with the largest amount of digits


## Time Taken:
This took 1 week to complete.

## Technologies:
- ReactJS -> Dependencies: Use-Sound, React-Toggle
- CSS


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
